## Coding on a VM vs. a Container

- VMs are deployed once, and then can be modified to install new software
  - You need to save "snapshots" to use your latest images
  - Storage is always persistent, and you can usually add extra volumes
  - VMs can support many workloads, such as running Docker or Kubernetes clusters
  - [üëÄ Docs for the VM install script](deploy-vm/)
- Deployed containers do not persist, and are often rebuilt
  - Containers can shut down when you are not using it, saving you money
  - All software and dependencies need to be defined in the `Dockerfile` or install script so they aren't destroyed on a rebuild. THis is great if you want to have a consistant environment every time.
  - Storage may not be redundant. You may have to use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to store your filesystem on a cloud service, for info:
